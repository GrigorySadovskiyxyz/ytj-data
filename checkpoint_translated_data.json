Start page List Instructions Link Return Service User Guidelines General search functions With the application form of the start page, you can apply for metal companies, objects and services either local/service or free phrase search. If necessary, you can limit the search results to the nearby area of the place you entered. No need to fill all fields, but one is enough. The more you meet, the more limited you get results. For example, if you enter the local area of the “river” and the context into the field of the “bael pillar” you will get a list of metal companies or regions where the term “river” is described and the teräel bars are selected. The name of the metal company or region may be in bent form; For example, \"Karimäki\" may be in the directory under the name \"Karimäki metal area\". This should be taken into consideration when selecting the application. If you’re looking for the word “carimäki”, you might not find the item if it’s written in the longer form mentioned above. Instead, you should apply for a partial word “carima” because that part of the word is found in all forms of bending. This should be remembered if you are experiencing difficulties looking for objects. The name must always be written. Start by clicking the Search button. If there is a lot of search results, they will be divided into pages, so a list of page numbers will appear on the right. From the search results list, you can view the data of each item by clicking on its name. Search results The results of the Location/Se.ce Search also include companies, addresses or municipalities whose activity or market area covers the e. terms defined in the search. For example, you’re looking for metal companies in your municipality of residence and you’ll also get search results from companies that may be domiciled elsewhere but are also available in the location you apply. You can limit the search results to the nearby area you entered, choosing a selection box. A free application search seeks search phrases from the company’s name, industry, address, contact, description and context data and may easily provide unne.ary search results. Alphabetical lists Instead of searching, you can find a metal company or service company using our list. Choose a letter, then you can browse the location you’re looking for on the numbered pages. There is also an alphabetical list of the municipalities of Finland. Missing information If you notice that an essential metal company is missing from our directory, or if there are errors in the report, you can contact the feedback page.

They cover everything from factorywarehouse catalogues to computerized maintenance management systems. These systems can overwhelm the users with their seemingly complicated interfaces that can lead to incorrect input into the system. It can also make finding pocket relevant information difficult. Operational maintenance has increased in modern factories and our application is a tool to satisfy that growing need. In the factory environment the operators carry out visual it tours to the production lines to check that everything is working like it should. 4Maint system relies on these visualizations and makes it more efficient to collect and analyze the data that they provide. This is the first time that we can collect tacit data from the factory maintenance. The 4Maint app creates a short cut to receive and update pocket relevant information to and from the CMMS backend systems. Through our 4Maint mobile application the maintenance worker has real-time access to the measurement data already available through various sensors and process control systems. Allowing for on-field analysis of hardware behavior based on both.al data and measurement data. This gives operators and the operating maintenance staff a lot better opportunity evaluate, act and react to different situations and risks in the production line such as the risks of unscheduled downtimes. Throughlessreless portable sensors connected to the mobile device, the 4Maint app can collect on-field data from hardware that are outside the measurement systems of the production line. This data can be utilized to corroborate possible maintenance findings and.s on the field. All measurement data will be displayed in user . continent.

ACE C Series C Series C Series BCSC density is a key metric in electrical engineering that indicates the concentration of power within a given volume. This measure is critical in comparing the efficiency of a system’s power or capacity to its size or volume, thereby optimizing performance and design efficiency. As ships become larger and more sophisticated, the power density of their machinery and equipment increases. The trend towards higher power density Over the past few decades, the power density of most machinery and equipment has increased, a trend driven by technological advances in a number of areas explains this. Two of the most important are the following:.ances in materials have played a critical role in increasing the power density of machinery and equipment. Innovations have led to lighter and stronger composites and met., such as advanced carbon fibre composites and high-strength, lightweight aluminium and ti.ium alloys. These developments make it possible to create lighter components that can withstand higher loads. In.ttery technology, advances in lithium-ion and other advanced chemistries significantly increase energy density. Improvements in semiconductor technology and electronics have also been instrumental in increasing power density. Theturiaturisation of transistors and other electronic components in line with Moore's Law (i.e. the number of transistors on an an circuit doubles every two years) has led to a dramatic increase in the computing power that can be accommodated in a given volume. This trend towards smaller component sizes has enabled the development of more compact devices that not only offer enhanced functionality but also operate with greater efficiency. Adwatec Water Cooling Systems is best,ed for high power density devices machines or equipment. Several key factors explain the greater effectiveness of water cooling in such situations: Water has a higher specific heat capacity than air, allowing it to absorb more heat before its temperature rises. This characteristic is especially advantageous for handling the considerable heat generated by high power density equipment, as it can a significantorb a significant amount of heat before cooling. Water has a higher thermal conductivity than air, allowing it to transfer heat faster and more effectively. This superior heat transfer capability allows water cooling systems to respond more quickly and efficiently to the heat generated by high power density equipment, thereby preventing overheating. Due to its high thermal capacity and conductivity, water can a.orb more heat per unit volume than air. This property equipments the design of compact cooling systems that are ideal for integration into high power density equipment where space is limited. As a result, water cooling systems efficiently support optimum performance without the need for bulky external cooling configurations. Water cooling systems can be tailored to deliver cooling where it is most needed. By placing cooling lines or heat exchangers close to heat-generating hotspots, especially in high power-density configurations, they can effectively manage the intense heat generated by specific components. This targeted cooling approach improves system efficiency and prevents localised overheating. As power density and associated heat generation increases, the effectiveness of air cooling systems tends to fall. These systems must circulate larger volumes of air or significantly increase airflow to dissipate the additional heat, which can result in increased noise and reduced energy efficiency. In contrast, water cooling systems are more efficient at handling higher heat loads without significantly increasing operating costs or noise levels. How Does Water Cooling Work? Using water to remove heat from a system is a relatively simple mechanism. First, the central element of a water cooling system is the heat source, which is fitted with heat sinks or cooling elements designed to dissipate the heat generated into a cooling medium. By increasing the surface in contact with the water, these heat sinks improve the efficiency of the heat transfer process. Second, cold water is pumped through a series of pipes within the system. As it passes through or over the heat sinks, it absor. heat from the heat source. This heated water must then be cooled to effectively maintain the continuous cooling cycle. Third, the heated water is discharged from the system to a heat exchanger where it can be cooled. There are two main types of heat exchanger used in such installations: Water-to-water heat exchangers: In this system, heated water flows through pipes or coils exchangemersed in a cooler water.th. The cooler water ex.s heat from the heated stream without mixing. Water-to-air coolers: In this arrangement, the heated water circulates through coils or plates exposed to the air. Either fans or natural air currents are used to dissipate the heat by blowing cooler air over these surfaces. What are the main features of Adwatec Water Cooling Systems? The key features outlined for the Adwatec water cooling system provide a detailed summary of its capabilities, design advantages and ease of use. Below is a breakdown of each feature and the benefits they provide: Cooling capacity up to 300 kW The maximum heat).al capacity of the system expressed in kilowatts (kW). With a heat.al capacity of up to 300 kW, this system can handle significant heat loads, which is ideal for high demand environments such as marine applications. This (300kW) relates to our standard portfolio, but bigger systems are also available. Coolant flow rate up to 750 l/min Highlights the peak coolant flow rate of the system, measured in litres per minute (l/min). A flow rate of 750 l/min.s the rapid circulation of a significant volume of coolant utilize the system, which is essential for efficient heat.al. Relates to our standard portfolio, but bigger systems are also available. Minimum footprint - typical installation is in a 600 x 600 mm cabinet The compact design of the cooling system is sized to fit into a 600 x 600 mm cabinet. Its Itimal footprint is especially.ed to environments where space is at a premium, allowing optimum use of available space while still providing robust cooling performance. Automatic de-airing is the process ofering air from the coolant, which is critical because air pockets can reduce efficiency and cause long-term damage to the cooling system. By keeping the coolant free of air, maintenanceic venting streamlines maintenance and increases system reliability. Easy to .ate into the cooling circuit: This feature indicates that the system has been designed for compatibility, making it easy to .ate into existing cooling circuits. This benefit is especially useful in retrofit scenarios or when expanding existing systems. Quick and easy commissioning: All of the above features allow for quick and easy commissioning. Commissioning time and effort by eliminating manual processes, and the visual coolant level indicators provide an easy method of monitoring and adjusting coolant levels to maintain optimum system efficiency. Stainless industrialel industrial pumps and carefully selected materials: The use of stainless.el for the industrial pumps and high quality materials for other system components increases durability and reliability. Stainless superel’s superior super to corro  and wear is critical for a cooling system that frequently interacts with a variety of coolers. These features combine to create a well-designed water cooling system that provides efficient, reliable and high performance cooling in a compact and manageable package. This system is especially well.ed to marine environments, where both performance and space efficiency are essential. Pablo Rodas-M.ini holds a PhD and an MSc from Queen Mary and Westfield College.

In traditional bladder tank system the de-airing may take days and the remaining air in the system may cause trouble even longer. The tank operating principle makes it simple and fast to de-air the system. With open expan. tank it is possible to collect the remaining air. While keeping the pump running small part of the coolant flow is leading to the tank where small air bubbles have enough time to separate from the coolant. This is a very effective method to get the system de-aered. Practically it takes only one or few hours to get the system de-aered instead of several days. Please click the button below to gain access to a test report. Tank without bladder lasts longer There is no bladder = no risk for breaking the bladder. Adwatec's expan. tank increases reliability: Coolant level monitoring as standard. Any system leaks can be detected at an early stage. Learn more about reliability any questions?

ACE C Series C Series B series the heat. This heat is not good for the electrical components in power electronics system and needs to be removed from the system. There are practically two principal methods to remove the heat from the system. Traditionally air has been used to remove the heat. The process principle is simple: air is circulated or blown through the heat generating system. The heat is practically blown away. Air cooling system requires an air circulation system with ducts and vents, a fan unit to move air and a cooler unit to cool down the heated air before it goes back to circulation. The other alternative to remove the heat is to use water. Here the process is simple as well: the heat source has heat sinks or elements that can be cooled with water. Cold water is circulated to the heat source and heated water is the lead out and cooled with a water-to-water heat exchanger or with a water-to-air cooler. Water cooling system requires a pipesystem, pumpstation and water-to-water heat exhanger or with water-to-air cooler units. There are seven features that separate water cooling from other cooling methods. Learn more below!

ACE C Series C Series BCSC NEEDS C-series is a highly flexible water cooling solution designed for demanding marine, OEM and industrial cooling applications. The series gives a new way to optimize your system with selectable heat exchangers, in-coming and out-going pipelines and communication and control.. A modular product structure gives the opportunity to have everything included in one unit or have a de-centralized solution with all key.es installed wherever applicable and available. Thanks to a approach based on unmatched expertise, the latest simulation techniques, exhaus. testing both in the lab and in the field, the result is a foundation of the highest quality and reliability available on the planet. Download Data Sheet Contact Us Key The.es are very small thanks to manifolds used instead of complex pipes. This reduces the number of components used and several operational functions can be combined in one. The construction is marine robust and very reliable. Less components means less risky connections. The expan. tank enables the monitoring of both the amount of liquid and air in the system. As there are no ru.er forgs or bladders in use, the construction lasts practically forever. The expan. tank and Adwatec’s de-aerating concept in a very fast commissioning time—few hours instead of days. Reliability Reliability In marine cooling applications the reliability is something that will never be compromised. Adwatec has delivered several hundred cooling units for vessels fromcctic cold to tropical heat. The experience from this is transferred to this.ar solution and the same reliability is now available for all vessels ranging from smallest to larger. Operation the cooling stations circulate coolant between power electronics and a heat exchanger. A three-way valve is used to ensure constant temperature and to avoid condensation in power electronics. Applications Drive and power electronics in marine, process, oil and gas industries and windmills and shore power. Power Electronics in?tteries and energy storages.

Allow selection CusRIize Allow All Powered by Cookiebot by Usercentrics Benefits of Water Cooling Benefits of Adwatec Products Value of Adwatec Products Applications and References Marine Power Grid Batteries and Energy Storages Heavy Industry Container Cooling References Products and Service M ACE C Series C Series BCRC adwatec was part of a completely new kind of project within the marine industry when the company a contract and was delivered to the solution that will cool down thettetteries of the world's largest plug-in hy.d vessel. Key Benefits of Adwatec's Cooling Solution: High-power cooling in compact size Fing delivery Easy commissioning Ulstein is a modern shipyard that builds vessels for offshore wind, exploration cruise, RoPax, and offshore oil and gas. It recently delivered the world's largest plug-in hy.d vessel, the Color Hy.d, for Color Line. The 160-meter long ferry, se.cing between Sandefjord in Norway andöömstad in Sweden, can accommodate 2,000 passengers and 500 cars. The Challenges and Ob.ives The ground-breaking vessel was to be equipped with four.ttery stacks consisting of several severalttery consists that will offer 5 MWh and can operate for up to 60 minutes at speeds up to 12k. For atterttery-powered vessel of this size, highly effective liquid cooling is a prerequisite. As a Passenger, RoRo Ship, the Color Hy.d is subject to strict safety and quality regulations. It is important that thetterttery remains remain at as.ady temperature as possible. To make sure the cooling is efficient enough for such a large.ttery pack, the cooling stations needed to have a higher coolant flow rate. At the same time, the cooling system pressure was not allowed to rise too much even in case of a leak and an anic closing of the coolant lines in the.ttery system. The dimensions and footprint of the cooling systems are kept as small as possible while maintaining the easy start-up and serviceability. These demands create some special challenges in the system design. The solution Adwatec is experienced in providing cooling solutions for power electronics in marine applications like drives and propul., with dozens of deliveries in vessels receiving all over the world. The Color Hy.d, Adwatec provides two C series water cooling stations, one on both sides of the ship. The stations are specifically designed to the to. conditions at high seas and limited space available in ships. The cooling stations were equipped with two pumps. One is in operation, and in case of a pump failure, the Red.ant pump steps in. The standby pump is automaticallyitched as duty pump every two weeks to ensure both pumps remain functional. To gain a high enough flow rate to supply the right temperature cooling water for the large number oftterttery.s. To control the flow rate and to keep the pressure from rising in case a leak is detected in thettetteries, the stations are equipped with fre.ency converters and a state-of-the-. control system. On-site commissioning support and user training were also included in the delivery. Results, the project, some rather significant modifications were made to the project scope as well as to thetterttery system initial data. Thanks to Adwatec’s agile engineering team and experience in the marine industry, the new requirements were applied without a substantial delivery delay. The cooling system was commissioned on time. The need for electrification of marine vessels is growing. The Pioneering Color Line Project introduces new technology in shipbuilding. The model created in this project will be easy to duplicate in building new hy.d ships.

Click the image for magazine. Water is an excellent medium to remove heat from heat loads like power electronics or.tteries. Too often water or liquid cooling is, claimed to be unreliable or complicated. That doesn’t need to be the case when certain basic matters have been properly considered during the product engineering, manufacturing, and commissioning and everyday use. The focus here is the coolant. Visual coolant level indication required water volume in coolant What coolant to use? The coolant to be used will be specified by the power electronics equipment supplier. Ethylene glycol and propylene glycol can be used as coolants. They alone do not have good corro.. It is necessary to add a corro. inhibitor to the coolant. Some heat transfer fluids already contain inhibitors. Typically, a glycol-based coolant with a concentration of 20-30% offers adequate corro. while while minimizing the reduction of cooling capacity caused by glycol. If an outdoor-installed water-to-air heater is part of the cooling circuit, the glycol concentration will be chosen to the ambient outdoor temperature. How to avoid galvanic corro?? All met. have a galvanic potential. When there is a connection between two met. that have a different galvanic potential, a galvanic circuit is formed and galvanic corro. may find place. The cooling liquid acts as a connector between the met.. Galvanic corro. can be minimized by using non-conductive materials between met. (i.e. plastic or ru.er) and thus disconnecting the galvanic circuit. The recommendation is to use stainless ael and high-grade aluminum (6000-series) and avoid copper and carbon.el-based materials. Copper materials are used, then aluminum shall not be used. There are two types cooling circuits: open systems and closed systems. An open system isn't pressurized and allows free contact with air, while in a closed system the piping is completely airtight and the pipelines are pressurized. Closed-type cooling systems are the most effective way to prevent oxygen diffusion in the coolant and to reduce the risk of corrochemical corro  Adwatec cooling unit designs have a sight glass for easy coolant level Par Particles in the circuit. During the manufacturing and installation process anything can and will happen. Metal and other particles may end up in the power electronics piping, cold plates and cooling system. It is a must to ensure that the system is clean. This can be done by flushing the system. Also later, during the operation when following the maintenance and renewing the coolant, the system flushing is important to remove particles that may have appeared in the system. Small particles cause wear and tear in the cooling system components and may lead to galvanic corro.. They may block tiny cooling channels in cooling elements leading to heat problems as well. Some cooling units have an an window through which the quality of the coolant can be checked. The cooling unit storaging Often the equipment will not be installed and comissioned immediately after manufacture but storaged for later use. Wrong coolant inside the cooling unit or no coolant at all may cause severe damage. Here it is important to ensure that the equipment is stored by the manufacturers.

We have designed our first cooling station models in close collaboration with them. Hence, we take the demands set by the to. conditions at high seas carefully into consideration already in our product development. The marine applications we provide cooling solutions for include propul. systems, thrusters, winches, andtterttery and energy storage systems. We provide both essential and non-essential solutions. Compact, easy to service In marine vessels, space is always limited. Our cooling units are compact: the C series cooling station footprint is only 600 x 600 mm with a 500 l/min flow. Compact size does not mean difficult se.cing. The.ar construction of our cooling stations makes each component easy to see and reach. This in turn leads to shortest possible visualization and service time. High quality components and the right materials chosen to avoid galvanic corro. make Adwatec cooling stations reliable in use.

An open fire is highly energy inefficient and requires a lot of wood. Family of 5 consumes 4000 kg of wood a year producing 6400 kg of CO2. An open fire produces massive air.lution with many dangerous pollutants that penetrate deep into the lungs. Indoor Inlution causes 4 million prem. deaths a year and diseases incl. pneumonia and chronic obstruc. pulmonary disease. Women in developing countries spend an average of 1.4 hours a day collecting firewood and 4 hours cooking. Women are heavily affected by indoor pollutions. Millions of children do not attend or complete primary education - Majority are girls who stay at home to do. labor. Fa ies in suburban areas a big part of their annual income on buying charcoal and lamp oil Unsustainable harvesting of firewood drives deforestation and forest degradation. High rates of deforestation causes: land ero., desertification, famine, destruction of animal habitat andooooding. Deforestation also forces people to leave their homes in search of better opportunities – in Europe and neighbouring countries.

Finns invent how to save Africa’s forests – in the Sambian village they no longer collect trees to burn but plant them – AfstorOy There are about 600 million people in Africa who cook their food with wood. The combustion tree causes forest destruction, desertification and carbon dioxide emissions – which accelerates climate change. Consequently, the use of firewood in its food plant is one of the biggest problems in Africa and the world. The Finnish company Afstor believes it has found the best solution to the problem. Lappeenranta Series Entrepreneur and Inventor Ari Biispanen, together with Jero Arola, Professor of Energy Efficiency at Lappeenranta-Lahti University of Technology, has developed a solar-.ric kitchen, which they hope to reduce the use of firewood in society. The family gets electric light. In Zam., not all children can go to school because they need a daily tree. It is also difficult to do lessons in the evening without electric light,” says Ari Piispanen, CEO of Afstor. For six months, 10 soups have been tested for dront in the villages of Southern California. The . Afstor soup has been tested for six months. Catneny/General The package includes solar panels,kuttery and induction cooker. The experiment was conducted by the Green Living Movement. The company said the cooking had made it easier for women and children to live because they didn’t we no longer need firewood. They were very happy with the kitchen. Village leaders and others have been grateful for this assistance in the experimental area of Southern Sambia, says Katja Mansikkaniemi, a member of the Board of Directors of the Green Living Movement. The Sahara Desert network is estimated to have grown by about 10% over the next 100 years. The deforestation in dry areas contributes to the ero. of the country, which makes it easier to spread deserts. This also happens in South Africa. The purpose of Afstor is to increase the planting of forests in areas where the kitchens are introduced. Planting the forest istaanked in the kitchen. The families who acquired the kitchen pay for the cooker by participating in the tree planting program in the area. “The Zam.,istry said that a cook should not be given free of charge because otherwise it is not appreciated enough.” In this model, people pay a small portion of the cooker each month by planting trees. Planting trees in Zam.. The GLM Sam. K.en is installed with a calculator to measure its use and thus generated emissions reductions. In.ally, the measurement takes place on the spot, but later the remote meters will be installed in the kitchens. In Africa, a family of five smokes an average of 4,000 kilograms of wood per year. It generates 6.4 tonnes of CO2 emissions. “There is no need for people to gather firewood for cooking,” he said. According to Bi.pase, customers in the West are ready for the supply, sale and maintenance chain in Sam.. It is composed by people from the GLM. The functionality of the kitchens has also been confirmed by a six-year experiment in the villages. Real customers for kitchens are Western companies and public communities that can replace their climate emissions by purchasing kitchens in Africa. This type of cooking reduces CO2 emissions more than an electric car we drive 50,000 kilometres a year, and at the price of one electric car, you can buy 40 soups. There is no clear understanding of the actual emissions reductions in electric vehicles, as the reduction depends largely on how much emissions are generated in the production of the vehicle and how the electricity used by the vehicle is generated. Millions of people In Africa, they cook their food with a fire. Aaron Ufumeli/EPA Cost of the K.en is $2,500. “The price includes a cooking system, transportation to the village and emissions for the next five years,” he said. The bi. says the marketing of stoves is starting. The city has already bought the first two soups. According to Bi.pase, Afstor has received a one-year grant from Business Finland. Currently, slu. will be gathered in Lappeenranta, but production will be transferred to Africa. In addition to about 20 cooking systems, Afstor has ordered parts for 100 new soups.

Biotech Container The AG. Biotech set-up is simple: Wastewater goes in, and water comes out, and between these there is the algae bioreactor and the biomass harvester. The trick is in the know-. and the clever system running the whole thing. Growth conditions are optimized in the artificial environment of our bioreactors. This allows for considerably higher growth and purity levels than in natural conditions. Biomass quality in various algae products can be optimized. In to run the process, the system keeps track of costs such as heat, electricity and nutrients to make mourn the output yields more than the input takes. Our system is all-in-one and scalable. The process requires carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxides, nutrients, and heating the wastewater that goes in. The purified water can be reused, even as drinking water. The system also produces dry algal biomass, assuming algae have a carbon mass fraction of 50%. Biomass is harvested once a month with an average yield of 50 kg.

We have six threads to reach the accuracy of thousands. In addition to products that require very high measurement accuracy, our expertise in landfill applications is the driving of large congestion ankuls, e.g. in different directions. We can take up to 60 degrees. A versatile machine fon allows the manufacture of even challenging pieces, namely, we also get CNC rodents, pricing, plug-ins and sp. drills. The maximum working area of ournre footwear is 520 x 370 x 400. What kind of work is suitable for smoking? Landfill is a versatile method to produce, for example, the kisses of extruders, the psychosis of the cutters and various components of the machine with accuracy of a few thousand parts. Difficult cross-sectional forms that cannot be worked, for example by rodent, can most often be threaded. The more detailed changes and the more demanding quality of the surface, the better the thread is suitable for it. It is not limited to the work of individual pieces, it is also suitable for serial production. The requirement for a combustible piece is sufficient coverage of electricity. The hardness of the piece does not matter, i.e. the method allows all met. to work, including hard met.. The advantage is a very good surface quality, which often eliminates the need for refrigeration. Since thermal handled materials can also be worked on the lare slide, significant changes in shape and dimensions will be avoided. The best quality of the surface is 0.3 μm Ra. What is larefoot? Electricity Leading ma.ls made within the workplace. At that time, electrical outbreaks are generated that cut the piece very closely. It is based on the same principle as the smoking. In all sp. work methods, the basic elements of the workplace are sp. work liquid, workpiece and  elerode. The  Urode is the same shape as the desired machine. In the case ofnre, the  elerode is a moving, electrically conductive material. The workpiece is cut with this  elerode. Landfill can produce complex forms. The shape must be extended through the paragraph. In the library, there are two things: Produce regular electrical impulses and control the  elerode.re. The workpiece and  elerode are connected to the opposite.es of the electrical circuit. It starts to produce electrical impulses. When the  elerodelanre is close enough to the workpiece, the spte work liquid becomes insulated as a result of a large natural breakthrough. The e.tion heats the surface of the workpiece from a small area. Part of the substance in the workpiece is melted and the piece is formed in the bubble. The size of the bubble depends on the intensity of the electric current and voltage. When a sufficient number of breakthroughs occur, the  elerodelanre moves through the workpiece and works in the forms programmed for thenre. The distance between the  elerode yarn and the workpiece at which the e.tion takes place is called the sp. interval. The lanrodelanre produces forms that are larger than the programmed track. The spinning interval is usually taken into consideration when programming the thread. The smallest possible interior  säus available to work is the diameter of the  elerode.re, added to the sisädth of the sp. interval. There are 2-5 programmable axles in thenre. In most cases, 5-axis threads are used. The programmed axles in thenre are: the  elerodeenre controller, the tilt of thellisre in X and Y directions, and the workpiece or move the lareless transport system in x and y directions.

The TIRE exhibition was a success, even though the global corona virus affected visitors. Many tyre manufacturers wereelnned from travel. The organizer took the situation very seriously. The body temperature was checked at the gate and everyone was asked to confirm their health. It was recommended to avoid handcuffs, and there was a hand bottle for everyone. However, the Akatools department visited representatives of major tyre manufacturers who were really interested in our products. We also met representatives of tyre manufacturers from Japan, Germany and Taiwan. Our interest was developed by innovative manufacturing solutions and we discussed a lot about pre-designers we have invested in. The result of the shot and, among other things, the accuracy led to complaints. The “from stock” service model received a good reception as its impact is directed at delivery times. We serve as efficiently as possible with semi-prepared products in our premises. The warehousing service also allows the delivery of parts on a tight schedule as the customer’s production continues uninter.ted, without long waiting times for spare parts. Several rapporteurs from Finland and the rest of the Nordic countries were involved, but Akatools was separated by their specialty products. We had several mentions about it, and with the help of local trade fair assistant Martina’s language skills, we talked with Spanish and Italian guests.

The AKAtools Quality and Environmental System was selected at the end of the three-month development project at the end of January 2020. Throughout this period, the company focused on looking at its operations with new eyes and developing ways of working better, more efficient and more environmentally .. What influence does it have on production, employee engagement and customer relationships? The improvements made were necessary until the production level, and the renewal of production created an excellent opportunity to make the voices of the employees heard better. The staff actively participated in the improvements and promoted the project with their own initiative. The renewed systems developed both internal and external communications of the company and were increasingly focused on customer satisfaction and the production of quality products. What is the need for certification, are there any changes to the previous practice? The work really yielded results. While common development meetings and solutions to unexpected challenges require time and energy, the positive outcome of the work rewarded effort. The reform of the systems clarified and uniformly improved the company’s operating practices and helped all the pieces related to the company’s operations to stabilize.

We work with a single-handed method, which means that all details are made into one fixed ai. This is how we get a tight piece with no leaks between different channels. This also ensures that the tendencies between channels are very small. We cannrelessly reach a 60-degree cone an., enabling the production of challenging preformers from one piece of work. With thinning technology, we can make demanding forms. The EDM drill allows small starting holes to be made for thinning. This method allows us to produce very small channels and shapes. Since all channels are made with thinning, the holes are cardic. This means less turbulence in can., allowing less ru.er to grab surfaces, i.e. less sticky, and allows for longer production cycles. After production, it’s easy to stop maintenance for the predenor when you let the preformer cool up so that the vulcanization happens and you can take out the cooled ru.er part of the canal as one piece. We haven’t focused on specific brands. All manufacturers are equally important to us – we provide our services with strong expertise for each customer. Innovatä Manufacturing – Two is One Steel belts We have patented method for the manufacture of teräel belt threads, i.e. hole irons. This new manufacturing method enables the manufacture of all hole sizes and the coating of holes, which increases the life cycle of hole iron. Holes do not need to be ro., other forms are possible. Our method of production, the thread, is famous for its accuracy. This ensures that all holes are very straight and straight. Tolerances are made according tolerellerre tolerances. Parallel, well tolerated holes are also a strong foundation for precisely optimizing thehap. The accuracy of our production method enables the design of very small channels between holes. Up to 200 threads can be made with 8\".el belts. We also manufacture other parts related to thread controllers, such as thread controllers and  huustick irons. As a material, we use a durable Toolox 33 toolnel, which, when nit., provides a slippery and hard surface of 0.1-0.4mm. It also improves surface wear,, reduces friction and gives better väsyigue strength. Other parts of the tyre industry are also in our selection.

The quality and purity of snow is the key factor when creating premium indoor snow and winter interior and experience. Different Kind of Snow is needed for the needs for activities and customer target groups. The light soaring down from the sky is very different compared to snow for building up a snowmen or having a snow fight. Snow will wear down in activity use and need to be replaced regularly and.. A Snow Production System needs to be carefully chosen for interior and activities chosen. The system needs to be chosen in early stage design process to make sure that system requirements as system placement, support technology and snow maintenance facilities are included and fitted in building layout and budget. Snow system or combination of systems is giving the visitors the very thing they came for – fresh and snow snow experience to enjoy. Indoor Snow Activity Snow is a delightful experiment to see and feel, but specially to do! High priority in design is needed to create balanced outcomes between activities, interior design and investments. Snow activities designed to different interests and age groups to ensure fun and enjoyment for each and every visitor. Selection of activities to be chosen for fun, sport and wellness ass well to different age and target groups. All activities need to reach high standards regarding safety, usability and maintenance.

Interior design needs to support different story and theme presentations for different visitor target groups. The development and introduction of new themes and stories are to be carried out fast and robust, when the interior system design is supporting the ideaingexibility and parameter configurations. For example, the lights inside the snow are not just for lighting, but important part of scene and visual technology. This idea needs to be considered and designed.

The report may indicate suspected violations or errors that violate the law. Personal dissatisfaction or complaint is not a matter of notice, but is taken into consideration with the supervisor or HR department as usual. Notification procedure We want a company culture where employees can openly report their needs and events that can cause problems for employees, managers and management. However, if it feels uncomfortable to report directly to an organization, for example, because of the fear of consequences, we have a separate reporting process in which the identity of the reporter is protected under the aforementioned Declarant Protection Act. To make the notification so that the identity is protected in AAE, the CFO Örjan Räikkönen and HR and Communications Coordinator Stina Åvist are responsible for the processing of the notifications received. Only they have the right to process notices and they are obliged to keep the declarant’s identity secret if they know who sent the notice. We ensure full protection for notifications inennce with applicable laws, regulations and regulations. We agree not to take any countermeasures against any person who made the announcement. The notification of the breach may also be submitted via the \"intermediary\" which is then obliged to provide the notice immediately to the reporting processors, see above. The intermediary shall also be subject to the confidentiality and shall not disclose the identity of the reporter without his consent. The notification shall be made in good faith and shall contain as detailed as possible a description of the alleged conduct, relevant individuals, as well as the grounds and any evidence for claims. If possible, documents supporting the claim must also be submitted. The notification is always handled confidentially. Notification channels The notification may be made either in writing or orally, by e-mail, telephone or at the request of the notifier at an agreed meeting (physical or online meeting). A letter sent in the mail addressed personally to someone in the company is also possible.

The notification shall be kept for 12 months after the person has received the notification of the measures taken. The notifier may contact the competent authority (making an external notification) if he has reasonable grounds to believe that the internal declaration has not led to action on the basis of the above-mentioned period of notification, it is not possible to effectively interfere with an infringement or that he or she is at risk of being subjected to countermeasures due to the notification.

This is an alternative solution to the traditional cylinder. The drying cylinder has direct endings to prevent the temperature variation in the e.s of the diaper. This ensures a consistent temperature up to the end. Stronger than a c. iron teräel plate allows the use of thinner diaper thicknesses and thus contributes to the efficiency and impact of heat transfer. Since the cylinder made from the teräel plate is flat and accurate, less workplace resources are needed in machinery, less ro. fingering, tutkiousal or repairs. The result is a fair product at reasonable investment costs. In addition, the disk cylinder requires much less tasapainolancing compared to the corresponding cylinder. Thanks to the dense structure of the Terel, a surface interior for the cylinder can be used to improve heat transfer and prevent dirt from sticking to the surface of the cylinder.

The purity requirements of production often require multi-stage washing solutions, in which case the pieces are detergent for collection or painting. If the washable pieces are encased or otherwise challenging in the drill, the washing machine can be equipped with an indoor washing system. The finishing after the washing process can be carried out with warm air blowing or hot circular drying, which is ready for the next phase. Service operations often require excellent preparedness before maintenance or repair work. Often a single-stage washing is enough, but pre-washing may be a good option for the washing process. The washing machines can be equipped with a hand washing unit, allowing them to be pre-washed safely inside the cha. before the actual washing process begins. here here the same hot washing fluid is used in prewashing as in the actual washing process, in which case the washing fluid is filtered through the washing machine filtering technology. A hand washing unit can replace a separate pressure washing place.

Ultrasound washing is a common choice in the metal and electronics industry, food and health care sectors, and laboratories – in many cases it is even a superior or only washing solution. It is an efficient, accurate and environmentally . washing method. We will be happy to help with the selection of equipment and other questions about ultrasound laundering. And ask more! What is ultrasound la?ry? Ultrasound washing is an effective way to remove various pollutants such as rasva and other common impurities. Washing does not damage the pieces, so it can be used in a variety of different materials and components. The advantage of ultrasound is that it can wash even the complex objects that many other technologies have very difficult or even impossible to wash. Ultrasound can be washed with: Different instruments, such as Electronic Aircraft Parts of Space Technology Food industry equipment Glossed surfaces of Hydraulics How does ultrasound work? Ultrasonic washing occurs by conducting an ultrasound in the washing fluid with a fre.ency of 25-130 kHz. This creates an ultrasound washing cavitation, resulting in small bubbles on the surface of the objects in the washing fluid, causing pressure in the washing body. Pressure attacks effectively remove rasva and dirty pieces. The washing fluid can be just water, but with a combination of washing and heating (about 30-80°C) and fre.ency fluctuations, a better result is achieved. Ultrasonic washing is also suitable for hard-to-clean parts (such as hydraulic blocks), cleaning even the smallest holes and cavities. Ultrasonic washing is efficient, environmentally . and functional. What makes ultrasound so good? Ultrasonic washing is a water-based and energy-efficient washing method for environmentally a washing. Method to effectively eliminate pollutants from difficult sites, clean all surfaces to which the washing fluid can penetrate. Works with many chemicals Want to read more about our blog?

In connection with the expanisen of the factory, we delivered a 3-stage ACV-1.7-C24-3SD2 washing machine designed to wash 2.4 pe pieces in the vertical position. The efficiency of the washing machine was increased by a two-door solution enabling cross-driving and a T-rail system located on the front door. The T-rail transit cars can be connected with transport wagons, allowing the washing machine to store objects that improve washing. Due to numerous washing machines, T-trailers and transport wagons, the washing machine has a very high capacity. In addition, the cargo allows the transport of washable goods in a factory environment without any additional time-consuming intermediaries. The life cycle of the washing fluid is maintained with an effective oil injection that occurs with the Aqua Clean OS Separator. The aircraft was also equipped with Aqua Clean’s self-designed side filter, which removes hard particles washing liquid and preventing the sack from being born on the bot. of the tank. The filter system contains an easily replacedsg filter that allows you to reach a particle size of less than 50 μm if necessary.
